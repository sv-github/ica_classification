'process_script_single_subject.m' is a single subject preprocessing script (for rs-fmri data) 


The two classification algorithms are contained in 'naive_bayes_15x15resize.m' and 'perceptron_mult.m.'
Helper functions used in the two algorithms are: 'binning_12.m,' 'imresize3d.m,' and 'sum_logs_4class.m.'



The code for the algorithms requires user defined IC matrices, an example is provided in the naive bayes script.
